This Python program displays randomly selected images at random times.  Every interval (specified by the user)
a random number from 1-10 is generated, and if it is 5, then a window is displayed.

The interval can be hard coded to create a true adware "virus" as well.
You can then use pyinstaller to create an EXE file.

NOTE: the imgdir directory contains sample images, but they can be replaced with anything.
